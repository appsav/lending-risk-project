I wanted to share this project with any potential employers as I do not have a proper education or work background with python and machine learning, but I felt that tangible evidence would be a compelling argument on my behalf. I started this project in June of 2024 from scratch. I did not use any out of the box models or any code from other submissions. I wanted to get as much out of this experience as I could.

This is a fully connected neural network model doing supervised learning on a real lending company's data as well as legitimate credit bureau records to predict outcomes for future customers. The results from a model's predictions can be fed into the Kaggle page for this challenge a submission in order to get receive feedback via scoring. For reference, I'm currently sitting at a score of 73 and the top team of data scientists who won the cash prize for this had a score of 80. I will be updating the model as I continue to improve on engineering additional data features from the raw data.

1) In order to run this model, you will need to extract these two files and install the pre-requisite python libraries.
2) The necessary datasets should be extracted to the same directory and are available at the bottom of the page for the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data
3) Running the file either via command prompt or your preferred programming environment will parse the data, run the training and optimization processes, and finally print a csv file of predictions for 48,000 potential applicants that you can submit to verify my python skills.

The file can be tweaked to experiment with parameters if one is so inclined.
